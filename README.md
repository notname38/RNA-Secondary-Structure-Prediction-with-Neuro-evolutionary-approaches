# RNA-Secondary-Structure-Prediction-with-Neuro-evolutionary-approaches
The problem of RNA secondary structure prediction consists of, given an RNA secondary sequence, to predict it secondary structure, i.e., the way in which the nucleotides connect to each other. This problem is relevant for evaluating the effectiveness of virus vaccines and the stability of different biological compounds. There have been some previous approaches in the application of deep learning to this problem. The goal of the project is to create more efficient NN architectures by means of neuro-evolution and compare with the existing approaches on realistic virus RNN data.
