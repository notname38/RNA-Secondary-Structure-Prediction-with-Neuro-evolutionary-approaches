# RNA-Secondary-Structure-Prediction-with-Neuro-evolutionary-approaches
The problem of RNA secondary structure prediction consists of, given an RNA secondary sequence, to predict it secondary structure, i.e., the way in which the nucleotides connect to each other. This problem is relevant for evaluating the effectiveness of virus vaccines and the stability of different biological compounds. There have been some previous approaches in the application of deep learning to this problem. The goal of the project is to create more efficient NN architectures by means of neuro-evolution and compare with the existing approaches on realistic virus RNN data.


## List of tasks:
Mention that this is temporal and more tasks might be added / removed as time goes by. This is just a mere idea.
* Research on project managing:
    * Planning.
        - Gant Diagrams.
        - Work tables.
        - More planning elements.
    * Hour estimation.
    * Risk management.
    * Work breakdown structure.
* Create the planning elements mentioned in the project managing research section.
* More elements will be added when the planning is done.
